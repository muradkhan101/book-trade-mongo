# MongoDB back-end

This is my back-end Node server using Express and Mongoose to create a REST api for my book trading app
It features PUT, POST, GET, and DELETE endpoints, as well as authentication using JSON Web Tokens and salting + hashing of password.

The front-end code can be found [here](http://github.com/muradkhan101/book-trading
